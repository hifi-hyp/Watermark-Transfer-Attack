# Watermark Transfer Attack

This repository contains the implementation for the **Watermark Transfer Attack**. It allows users to perform studies and experiments related to watermarking in the context of data transfer and its vulnerabilities. 

## Features
- Implemented watermark transfer attack algorithms.
- Easy-to-follow script execution.
- Configurable for custom datasets and scenarios.

---

## Requirements
Before using this repository, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure you have Python >= 3.8.

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main implementation scripts.
- `data/`: Directory to store datasets.
- `outputs/`: Directory for the generated outputs and logs.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file to set parameters for the attack.

---

## How To Use
### Step 1: Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hifi-hyp/Watermark-Transfer-Attack.git
cd Watermark-Transfer-Attack
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment
Install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Prepare Data
Ensure that the relevant datasets are placed under the `data/` directory. You can specify dataset paths in the `config.yaml` file.

### Step 4: Configure the Parameters
Modify the `config.yaml` file according to your desired setup:
- `dataset_path`: Path to the dataset to be used for experiments.
- `output_dir`: Path to directory where outputs will be stored.
- More parameter configurations will be detailed in the comments of the `config.yaml` file.

### Step 5: Run the Attack Script
Execute the script:
```bash
python src/main.py --config config.yaml
```
This will run the attack using the specified configuration.

### Step 6: Analyze Results
Results, logs, and processed data will be saved in the `outputs/` directory. Check the generated files to analyze the outcomes of the watermark transfer attack.

## Customization
To adapt the implementation for your own use case, modify scripts in the `src/` directory.
- `main.py`: Main driver script.
- `watermark_attack.py`: Implementation of the core logic for watermark transfer attacks.
